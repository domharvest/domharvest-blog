If you need local business data for lead generation, market research, or outreach, Google Places is one of the most reliable sources.

But most tools that extract Google Places data are either:

- SaaS products with monthly limits and hidden pricing, or
- scripts that break after a few hours and require constant supervision.

DomHarvest Places is built to solve the real problem:

**Extract Google Places business data at scale, locally, using your own API key, with predictable costs and no subscriptions.**

---

## What it does

DomHarvest Places is a local desktop app that extracts Google Places results and exports them to CSV or JSON.

You run it on your machine.
You use your own Google API key.
Your data never leaves your computer.

This means:

- **No SaaS**
- **No subscriptions**
- **No monthly limits**
- **No account required**
- **One-time purchase, lifetime license**

## Why this approach matters

If you’ve tried Google Places extraction before, you already know the pain points:

### 1. SaaS limits kill real workflows
A “monthly credit” model works for small tasks.
It fails when you need *hundreds or thousands* of records for real work.

### 2. Hidden costs make extraction unpredictable
You can’t plan a project when the cost is unknown until the job is done.

### 3. Long extractions fail halfway
A real dataset extraction can take hours.
If it fails, you lose time and quota.

DomHarvest Places was built to remove these problems.

## What you get

### 1) Export clean business datasets
The tool outputs CSV or JSON files ready for:

- CRM import
- Outreach campaigns
- Market research
- Local business analysis

### 2) Search by text or by category + region
You can run:

- text search (e.g. “barbers near London”)
- grid search by category + region

### 3) Deduplication included
Duplicates are removed during extraction based on:

- Place ID
- Phone number

This makes the output reliable and usable.

### 4) Filtering before export
You can filter results while extracting:

- include keywords
- exclude keywords
- optional phone requirement

You don’t need to clean thousands of rows in Excel.

### 5) Cost estimates before running
You see an estimate of the API cost before starting the extraction.

This removes the “surprise bill” problem.

### 6) Pause and resume
Long runs can be stopped and resumed.
No wasted quota. No reruns.

## Who this is for

DomHarvest Places is designed for:

- freelancers and agencies doing lead generation
- researchers collecting local business data
- anyone who needs Google Places datasets without SaaS limits

It is **not** a consumer tool. It is a productivity tool for people who work with data.

## Example use case

- Extract **2,500** local businesses in a region
